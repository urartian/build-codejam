# CodeJam - With SAP Build, Create Apps, Processes, and Business Sites Without Coding

## Description

This repository contains the material for the CodeJam on using **SAP Build** to create a process, an app, and a business site. 

Specifically, you will get to know the environment by creating:

* A sales order approval process (**SAP Build Process Automation**).
* An app that lets users specify sales order data and trigger that process (**SAP Build Apps**).
* A business site in which you will embed that app (**SAP Build Work Zone**) (optional).

### What you will build

You will build an application that allows a user to enter sales order data, and then allows a manager to approve the sales order. To make all this simpler for the user, you will embed the app inside a business website along with other related apps and tools.

To accomplish this, you will create 3 inter-related parts using for each one of the SAP Build tools:

- First, you will create the process with SAP Build Process Automation for taking sales order details, which will send a request for approval to the manager.
- Second, you will create an app with SAP Build Apps that allows a user to enter sales order details and sends the data to the process and triggers the process.
- And third, you will create a workspace in SAP Build Work Zone and embed the app there. (optional)
