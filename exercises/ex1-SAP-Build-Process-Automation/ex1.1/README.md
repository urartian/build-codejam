# Exercise 1.1 - Create Sales Order Business Process 

In this exercise, we use SAP Build Process Automation to create a simple process for approving a sales order.

![Process](../../../images/ex1.1/process.png)

The process receives the sales order details and then either:

- Automatically approves the sales order if it is below a certain threshold.
  
- Sends an approval form to the specified approver. Once the approver approves, the process ends.
