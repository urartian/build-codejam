# Exercise 2.1 - Create SAP Build App to Trigger Workflow
 
In this exercise, we use SAP Build Process Automation to create a simple process for approving a sales order.

When making the app, you will:

- Create the UI.
- Set up a connection to the SAP Build Process Automation API.
- Test the connection.
- Create a data variable to hold the sales order details and bind it to the UI.
- Create a button and add logic to trigger the workflow.

## Summary

You have now created a simple app that lets users enter sales order details and trigger an approval process.

Next, we will improve the app by letting users select the product in a dropdown list instead of typing in the product code.
