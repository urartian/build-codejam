# Exercise 2.3 - Check Status of Process from SAP Build App (optional)
 

In this exercise, we will create a record of the processes we trigger by storing each process instance's ID in the local device storage, and then use an SAP Build Process Automation API to check the status of the process.

You will also see how to create another page in your app, and to use the Navigation feature to go between the 2 pages.
