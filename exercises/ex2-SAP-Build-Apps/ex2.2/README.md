# Exercise 2.2 - Populate Dropdown with SAP Data â€“ ES5 (optional)

In this exercise, we want to create a dropdown list for selecting the product, instead of an input field, to make it easier for the user.

![Process](/images/ex2.2/run-dropdown.png)

The data for the dropdown list will be coming from the [demo ES5 system](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/06/16/netweaver-gateway-demo-es5-now-in-beta/), a system used by developers working with SAP Fiori, SAP BTP and other SAP systems.

>You do not have to directly connect with the ES5 system. We have already created a destination, with the proper credentials.

You will do the following in the exercise:

- Set up a connection to the ES5 system (using the destination).

- Create a data variable to hold the retrieved data.

- Add and configure a dropdown list into the UI.
